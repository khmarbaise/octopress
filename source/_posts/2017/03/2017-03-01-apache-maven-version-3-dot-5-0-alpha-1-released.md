The Apache Maven team would like to announce the release of [Maven 3.5.0-alpha-1](https://maven.apache.org/).

NOTE: This is an ALPHA release. There is the potential that features may be
added/removed between this release and the first GA release in the 3.5.x
release line.
Please consult the Known Issues section below before use

You can download the appropriate sources, etc. from the archives section on
the download page as Maven 3.3.9 is still the recommended GA release

Known Issues

The following issues were identified during release testing of this ALPHA
release but have not been deemed as release blockers:

* {% ajl MNG-6177 %} The `--file` and `-f` option to specify a `pom.xml` to use
does not work if the path includes characters that need quoting such as
whitespace or `&`.
* {% ajl MNG-6115 %} If Maven is installed in a writable location, every build will
create a new `lib/ext/jansi-....` file.

Why not Maven 3.4.0?

After Maven 3.3.9 was released, the Eclipse Aether project was retired and
the code base was migrated to the Apache Maven project.

The original goal for the 3.4.0 release was to replace Aether with the
exact same code after migration to the Apache Maven project and then
proceed with bug fixes to the resolver code as well as other areas of Maven.

The migration of the code between the two foundations took longer than
expected and as a result there were other changes committed to Maven core
that were outside the scope of intent for 3.4.0.

In order to refocus on the original intent for 3.4.0, the decision was
taken to revert the Maven core history to the point of the 3.3.9 release
and merge in the desired changes one at a time.

Because there had been a lot of communication about different features
being delivered and bugs fixed in Maven 3.4.0 and the new history may not
contain them in the first release, the decision was taken to forever burn
the 3.4.x release line.

More detail on this decision can be read in the [mailing list archive](https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@maven.apache.org/msg112103.html).
