The Apache Maven team is pleased to announce the release of the 
[Maven Archiver, version 3.0.2](https://maven.apache.org/shared/maven-archiver/).

The Maven Archiver is mainly used by plugins to handle packaging. The version
numbers referenced in the Since column on this page are the version of the
Maven Archiver component - not for any specific plugin. To see which version of
Maven Archiver a plugin uses, go to the site for that plugin.

You should specify the version in your project's dependency configuration:

``` xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.shared</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-archiver</artifactId>
  <version>3.0.2</version>
</plugin>
```

You can download the appropriate sources etc. from the [download page][download-page].
 
 
Important Notes since Version 3.0.0:

 * Maven 3.X only
 * JDK 6 minimum requirement
