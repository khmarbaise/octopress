You have decided to write a Maven Plugin. Now the important part comes around the corner: 
How to test a Maven Plugin? There are in general several options to test a Maven Plugins for example:

* [Maven Invoker](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-invoker-plugin)
* [Maven Verifier](https://maven.apache.org/shared/maven-verifier/)
* [Maven Plugin Testing Harness](https://maven.apache.org/plugin-testing/maven-plugin-testing-harness/index.html)
* etc. 

You can read about [different reason][background] not to use one of those options.

Coming back to the subject and think about to write integration tests for a Maven plugin.
Writing integration test means having three parties involved:

1. The component you would like to test (typically the Maven plugin/Extension etc.).
2. The testing code by which you check the functionality.
3. The Project you would like to test with (where your Maven plugin usually is configured in to be used.)

Let us start with a simple test case which simply requires that the build which contains 
your new plugin to run successful. This looks like this by using the [Integration Testing Framework][itf]:

```java
@MavenJupiterExtension
class FirstMavenIT {

  @MavenTest
  void the_first_test_case(MavenExecutionResult result) {
    assertThat(result).build().isSuccessful();
  }

}
```
The written tests is easy to understand? Isn't it? The foundation of the [Integration Testing Framework][itf]
is the [JUnit Jupiter extension][junit-jupiter-extension] mechanism which allows to easily write
extensions which can do many things. 

Going back to the given simple integration test we need now two other parts to get a working integration
test. The code of the plugin (which I assume already exists) and of course the project where you would like
to test your plugin with.

The above is an integration test written by using the [Integration Testing Framework][itf]
(ITF for short) which exactly does that.

So a bit more nifty details here. The `@MavenJupiterExtension` is the annotation to activate the
ITF extension. The `@MavenTest` is the equivalent for unit tests which are annotated with `@Test` 
of course it makes it very clear that we are in the context of a test for Maven.

Ah finally we have the parameter of the test method `MavenExecutionResult result` which gives
you access to the result of the build and many more. The `assertThat(..)` is a customer
assertions for `AssertJ` to make writing assertions more convenient.

So now we have to define the project which is used to use our plugin. As always in [Apache Maven][maven]
you should follow convention over configuration and the ITF is not an exception of that.
We locate the integration itself into the usual location of test like `src/test/java/...`. 
I recommend to name your integration tests like `*IT.java` but of course you 
can change that if you like.
```
.
└── src/
    └── test/
        └── java/
            └── org/
                └── it/
                    └── FirstMavenIT.java
```
So now we need to put the project into a particular location like this:
``` 
.
└── src/
    └── test/
        └── resources-its/
            └── org/
                └── it/
                    └── FirstMavenIT/
                        └── the_first_test_case/
                            ├── src/
                            └── pom.xml
```
It is important to mention that the directory `FirstMavenIT` represents the integration
test class and the `the_first_test_case` directory represents the method name of the integration
test class. This will give us the opportunity to define several test cases within the class.
Based on the association between method name and directory name it is necessary to write
method names in lowercase and separate by using an underscore. If you use camel case method 
names this could cause issues with case insensitive file systems.

As you can see that the directory `the_first_test_case` contains a full fledged project which comprise
of a `pom.xml` file and of course the usual structures for source code and maybe unit test etc.


Let us take a look into the `pom.xml` of the project which is used to test our plugin:
```xml
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>com.soebes.itf.jupiter.extension</groupId>
      <artifactId>itf-failure-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>@project.version@</version>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <id>the_first_test_case</id>
          <phase>initialize</phase>
          <goals>
            <goal>failure</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```
One interesting thing is important here: `@project.version@` which represents the current version
of your plugin project.

There are some requirements to use the ITF:

* JDK 8+
* Apache Maven 3.1.0 or above.


To get the integration tests running we need to add some parts to the projects `pom.xml` which
is at first the dependencies to ITF:

The dependency `com.soebes.itf.jupiter.extension:itf-assertj` contains custom assertions of 
[AssertJ][assertj] in case you want to use AssertJ as your assertion framework. This means you have to 
include `org.assertj:assertj-core` as well. If you don’t want to use AssertJ as assertion framework you
can omit them both.

```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.soebes.itf.jupiter.extension</groupId>
      <artifactId>itf-extension-maven</artifactId>
      <version>0.9.0</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
      <artifactId>junit-jupiter-engine</artifactId>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.soebes.itf.jupiter.extension</groupId>
      <artifactId>itf-assertj</artifactId>
      <version>0.9.0</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.soebes.itf.jupiter.extension</groupId>
      <artifactId>itf-jupiter-extension</artifactId>
      <version>0.9.0</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.assertj</groupId>
      <artifactId>assertj-core</artifactId>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
```
You need to add the resource filtering like this:

```xml
<testResources>
  <testResource>
    <directory>src/test/resources</directory>
    <filtering>false</filtering>
  </testResource>
  <testResource>
    <directory>src/test/resources-its</directory>
    <filtering>true</filtering>
  </testResource>
</testResources>
```
The first one for `src/test/resources` might be change based on your own requirements. The
second is needed to copy the test projects to the appropriate locations.
So now we need to go for the `itf-maven-plugin` like this:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>com.soebes.itf.jupiter.extension</groupId>
  <artifactId>itf-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>0.9.0</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>installing</id>
      <phase>pre-integration-test</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>install</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```
which is responsible to copy your plugin/extension to the correct location and finally the
[maven-failsafe-plugin][maven-failsafe-plugin] to execute the integration tests like this:
```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <systemProperties>
      <maven.version>${maven.version}</maven.version>
      <maven.home>${maven.home}</maven.home>
    </systemProperties>
  </configuration>
  <executions>
  <execution>
    <goals>
      <goal>integration-test</goal>
      <goal>verify</goal>
    </goals>
  </execution>
</executions>
</plugin>
```
So now you can run the integration tests simply by using:

```
mvn clean verify
```
After the execution you will find a directory a structure like this:

```text
.
└──target/
   └── maven-it/
       └── org/
           └── it/
               └── FirstMavenIT/
                   └── the_first_test_case/
                       ├── .m2/
                       ├── project/
                       │   ├── src/
                       │   ├── target/
                       │   └── pom.xml
                       ├── mvn-stdout.log
                       ├── mvn-stderr.log
                       └── mvn-arguments.log
```
The directory `the_first_test_case` represents the test case from our original integration test
class `FirstMavenIT`. The project which has been used to test the plugin is put into the directory
 `project` which also contains the `target` folder after a run of such project. The directory `project` 
is the location where you can go into and start manually Maven by using the command line arguments 
which are stored in `mvn-arguments.log`. The result of this execution is redirected into `mvn-stdout.log` and
the redirection of stderr is logged into `mvn-stderr.log`. The directory `.m2/repository` 
contains the local cache (aka maven repository) of that build.
