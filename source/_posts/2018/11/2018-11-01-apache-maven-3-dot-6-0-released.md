The Apache Maven team is pleased to announce the release of the Apache
Maven 3.6.0.

Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based
on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a
project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of
information.

You can find out more about Apache Maven at https://maven.apache.org

You can download the appropriate sources etc. from 
the [download page](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
